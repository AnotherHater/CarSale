# Car Sale

This is a car dealership demo page made with the object of improving my skills as a developer. At this moment is under development

## Preview of the page.

This is a preview of the landing page, you can read about the "company" or start looking for a car instead.

## Auth & Register modals.

I've customized the default auth of laravel and implemented mine as a modals in order to reduce the number of screens and make it more comfortable at the moment of requering this actions.

## Filter Section.

This section is a pre-search, you may select a type of car or brand on this page. I decided to use referential images for types of cars and a description for brands to make the selection more friendly for the user.

## Results Section.

This section includes a sub section for sorting by filters. I decided to use Isotope to make this happen because it offers a cool transition when filtering the results. Also let you combine filters to make the result more accurate.
